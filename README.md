# iPhone Organizer 

Everyone always has specific places where they like their apps to go on their phone. It's muscle memory to get to them, and we take that layout for granted.But how confused would you be if someone rearranged your apps?

Fortunately for us, we can use CSS positioning to put our apps back in their original spots, just like in the image below!

If you look at the site in the browser, you'll notice the icons are all clumped together to the left of the iPhone. They're not even on the screen! Our job is to move the icons to their appropriate spots, just like in this image

### Step 2:

Open `index.html` in the browser by running in terminal ` `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. 

Once you have the server running, select `preview` and then `port 3000`.

You're going to code your solution in `css/style.css`. Go ahead and open that file in Nitrous, as well as `index.html`. You'll want to familiarize yourself with the code there. 

### Step 3:

Take a look at `index.html`. You should notice several things:

+ The app icons are grouped into threes

+ Each icon group is in their own `div`

+ The three divs are also in a single `div` with the id `iphone`

If you look at the site in the browser, you'll notice the icons are all clumped together to the left of the iPhone. They're not even on the screen! Our job is to move the icons to their appropriate spots.
